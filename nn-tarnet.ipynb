    "# Tutorial 1: Introduction to Deep Learning for Causal Inference on Observables\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tutorials are a gentle introduction to building deep learning models for causal inference using the selection on observables identification strategy. In particular, these model are designed to estimate the  average treatment effect (ATE) and the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). The ATE is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ATE =\\mathbb{E}[Y(1)-Y(0)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Y(1)$ and $Y(0)$ are the potential outcomes had the unit received or not received the treatment, respectively. The CATE is defined as,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$CATE =\\mathbb{E}[Y(1)-Y(0)|X=x]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X$ is the set of selected, observable covariates, and $x \\in X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because selection on observables is a simple identification strategy, these estimators are simple neural networks. This tutorial is thus also a gentle introduction to writing models in TensorFlow, and getting started coding deep learning models.\n",

    "## Why use deep learning for causal inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Appropriately built neural network models are among the **lowest bias** estimators in our statistical arsenal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For similar reasons, the complex response surfaces learned by neural networks make them well-suited for estimating **heterogeneous treatment effects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Most excitingly, deep learning has the ability to allow us to control for confounding found in **complex data types like images, text, and networks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Although most of these models don't make theoretical guarantees, representation learning **might be more robust to empirical violations of overlap** than simpler adjustment strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Although most of these models don't make theoretical guarantees, representation learning **might be more robust to bias induced by including instruments**  in your conditioning covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more point: even if we cannot formally satisfy causal inference assumptions, these architectures are still very useful for **creating interpretable ML models** where we can isolate the contributions of specific covariates to predicting the outcome."

    "## Representation learning as a balancing strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "A core concept in deep learning is the idea that artificial neural networks have the capacity to project a set of complex features $X$ into a useful vector space. When data are transformed into this space, we call the resulting tensor a **representation** ([Goodfellow, et al. 2016](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/representation.html)) (you might also see the term \"embedding\"). For social scientists most comfortable with linear models, we can think about the parameters in each feed-forward layer of a deep neural network as capturing every possible interaction between the values produced by the previous layer. Tasking the network to minimize error on a relevant downstream task encourages it to adjust these interaction parameters to learn useful representations. We can also think about these representation layers as automatically extracting useful  latent covariates/features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key intuition in this literature is that we want to train neural networks to learn a representation function $\\Phi(X)$ where the data are deconfounded/balanced in the representation space. In other words, the distributions of the representations $\\Phi(X|T=0)$ and $\\Phi(X|T=1)$ are similar.\n",

    "\n",
    "To encourage balanced representations, [Johansson et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03661.pdf) propose a simple two-headed neural network called Treatment Agnostic Regression Network (TARNet). Each head models a separate outcome. One head learns the function $\\hat{Y}(1)=h(\\Phi(X),1)$, and the other head learns the function $\\hat{Y}(0)=h(\\Phi(X),0)$. Both heads backpropagate their gradients to shared representation layers that learn $\\Phi(X)$. Again, the hope is that these representation layers will learn to balance the data because they are used to predict both outcomes.\n",

    "The IHDP dataset used in this example is a naturalistic simulation introduced in [Hill, 2011](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2010.08162?casa_token=b8-rfzagECIAAAAA:QeP7C4lKN6nZ7MkDjJHFrEberXopD9M5qPBMeBqbk84mI_8qGxj01ctgt4jdZtORpu9aZvpVRe07PA  ) to evaluate estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects ($CATE$). The  25 covariates/features for the 747 units (139 treated) in the dataset were taken from an experiment, but Hill simulated the outcomes to create known counterfactuals. The data are available from Fredrik Johansson's website. IHDP is the de facto benchmark in this literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary>Additional details from Hill, 2011</summary>\n",
    "<blockquote>[Hill] used experimental data from the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP), a randomized experiment that began in 1985, targeted low-birth-weight, premature infants, and provided the treatment group with both intensive high-quality child care and home visits from a trained provider.... [The response surface] is nonlinear and not parallel across treatment conditions, with $Y(0)∼\\mathcal{N}(exp((X+W)\\beta_B),1)$ and $Y(1)∼\\mathcal{N}(X\\beta_B−\\omega^s_B,1)$, where $W$ is an offset matrix of the same dimension as $X$ with every value equal to 0.5, $\\beta_B$ is a vector of regression coefficients (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) randomly sampled with probabilities (0.6, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1,0.1). For the sth simulation, $\\omega^s_B$ was chosen in the overlap setting, where we estimate the effect of the treatment on the treated, such that theconditional average treatment effect for the treated equals 4.</blockquote>\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "`y` is the simulated outcome that may represent $Y(0)$ or $Y(1)$ depending on `t`. Note that we rescale it here to improve convergence. `mu_0` and `mu_1` are \"noiseless\" potential outcomes where Hill simply used the mean of the normal distribution described in the spoiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 100 stochastic simulations in this data. For this example we will just use the eighth one."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary>A brief spoiler about training neural networks if you've never done so before.</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use other types of machine learning models, optimization of the model parameters is typically done for you under the hood and you simply wait for training to finish. In contrast, neural networks have so many parameters that optimization becomes an art.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than training on the whole training dataset at once, neural networks are trained on mini-batches of dozens to a few hundred examples. This is a compromise between applying error gradients from a single example (computationally expensive) and using the whole training dataset (expensive in terms of memory; may not work as well for losses that are not perfectly convex). The error gradient is applied to the network parameters after each mini-batch. A complete iteration through all mini-batches in the training set is called an **epoch.**\n",
    "\n",
    "After each epoch we run prediction on the entire validation set. While there are a number of regularization techniques used in DL to prevent overfitting (norms, dropout, batch normalization), the most important is **early stopping.** To prevent overfitting, we wish to stop training after several consecutive epochs where the validation loss has failed to improve. The number of epochs to wait after early stopping is often called a *patience* hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportion of the gradient the optimizer backpropagates to the parameters is called the **learning rate.** A learning rate that is too small takes a long time to train. A learning rate that is too large will overshoot optima. Learning rate schedulers are used to adaptively slow the learning rate as you get closer to an optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Shi uses the builtin Keras `.fit` infrastructure for training the model which makes things super easy. There are a lot of hyperparameter choices here, but I won't dwell on them because hyperparameter selection will be covered in the next tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    " In this example we use stochastic gradient descent to optimize the model with an initial learning rate of 1E-4 and momentum of .9. You can also try other optimizers (e.g., ADAM). **While you should experiment with different learning rates, I recommend having a conservative (smaller) learning rate because we really want our estimator to be unbiased.**\n",
    "\n",
    " To avoid overfitting, we stop training deep learning models when the validation loss stops improving. In Tensorflow the `EarlyStopping` callback automatically stops training after a number of epochs with no improvement on the validation loss (`patience` parameter). The `ReduceLROnPlateau` adaptively lowers the learning rate of the optimizer as we approach validation loss plateaus so that the optimizer does not overshoot the current optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a mini-batch size of 64. Other papers have recommmended batch sizes up to 200 with this dataset. **The batch size is an important consideration for these causal inference architectures because you really want to make sure each mini-batch has both treatment and control examples for the representation layers.** This is obviously less of a problem for datasets with high proportions of treated units."
